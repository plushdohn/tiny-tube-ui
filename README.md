	☕️ A minimal UI for <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>
</p>

# Disclaimer

This is something I made for myself as I needed a quick UI for downloading mp3's with minimal interaction (also I wanted to try out Tauri). If you still decide to use this though, feel free to open issues for suggestions or improvements. I'll try to address them if possible.

# Requirements

This project assumes you installed [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) on your system, and that they are available globally.

> Why don't you ship yt-dlp and ffmpeg with the app?

This project does so little that I find it almost insulting to not credit yt-dlp by having users install it themselves. I might change my mind in the future though.
